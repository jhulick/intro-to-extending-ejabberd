GOAL: network of 2 nodes, use to demonstrate clustering the 2 erlang instances,
      mnesia and ejabberd

* TODO: create ejabberd user, set ownership appropriately

* TODO: have the downloads cache files into /tmp/vagrant-cache/tmp - then the
  donwloads will survive the vm's being destroyed and re-created.  This will
  speed up the process of sanding off and starting again from scratch.  Consider
  doing this for the bash_profile as well.

* TODO: add host entries so the 2 nodes can see each other by logical name
    https://github.com/nickcanz/memcache_example/blob/master/Vagrantfile
* TODO: create an erlang cookie to be shared by both nodes for the jabber process

* TODO: cookbook to install rvm
* TODO: cookbook to install emacs configuration


* TODO: configure the 2 erlang nodes to be clustered
* TODO: update the mod_debug code to be globally registered on the cluster so it
  can be called from and interacted from any of the nodes in the clsuter



* NOT NEEDED: set up ssh authorized_keys and a trust relationship between the 2 nodes
* DONE: set up shared network in the 2 nodes
    https://github.com/nickcanz/memcache_example/blob/master/Vagrantfile
* DONE: cookbook to install bash profile
* DONE: create 2nd node's vm
* DONE: cookbook: install ejabberd from source
    http://www.process-one.net/downloads/ejabberd/2.1.12/ejabberd-2.1.12.tgz
* DONE: put the limits and packages cookbooks into a github repo, 
    reference it from the Cheffile (librarian-chef)
